# Proof of Concepts Repository

***
This repository contains proof of concepts (POCs) for various projects and microservices that I am currently working on. These POCs are designed to explore and demonstrate different architectural patterns, technologies, and best practices in modern software development.

***Technologies***
=================
* java
* kotlin
* spring (entire spring eco-system)

***Projects***
==============
The repository is organized into multiple projects and microservices, each focusing on specific aspects such as authentication, real-time updates, RESTful services, and more.

***Purpose***
=============
The purpose of this repository is to experiment with and showcase different approaches to building scalable, maintainable, and production-ready services. These concepts will eventually be applied to larger, more comprehensive projects.
